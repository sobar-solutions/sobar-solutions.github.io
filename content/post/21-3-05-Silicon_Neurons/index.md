Experiments with live tissue is notoriously difficult and costly, especially for teaching. Neuromorphic devices can be built cheaply to emulate real-world data as well as real-world measurement problems. In this project our team members assisted with the design, code and teaching using a cheap silicon neuron, 'Spikeling'. Courses and tutorials at several British and African universities currently use the Silicon Neuron.

Electrophysiological measurements are the bread and butter of a neurophysiologist. Neurophysiology and neuroscience students can study electrical properties of several kinds of neurons using the silicon neuron. The teaching appliance has to be cheap and scalable in production, to empower even the more underprivileged educational institutions. At the same time, the appliance has to introduce the students to electrical engineering concepts.

The neuron is an integrated circuit plate that runs its own C code, connects to a PC, and can be manipulated to provide realistic-looking electrophysiological data. The 'Spikeling' runs several programmatically-defined model neurons, using the Izhikevich autoregressive template. Such programs imitate several neurons' spiking behaviour in response to electrical or photo-stimulation. The students provide such stimulation and study the input-output relationships in presence of noise and static non-linearities.

Along with the data-generating hardware and software, the package includes data analysis and plotting routines. The software is written using a mixture of C, Python and MatLab. Improvements and maintenance of the project are done by the Open Neuroscience company.
