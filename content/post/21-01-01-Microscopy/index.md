During his PhD, Philipp was involved in 2-photon microscopy research. 2-photon microscopy is typically an expensive endeavour, with SotA setups costing around 120k USD. This project resulted in an accessible, cheap to make, multiple site-access optical and control set-up with no loss in optical prformance. The set-up is maintained by Dr Filip Janiak, and is used in multiple research laboratories across the UK.

2-photon microscopy focusses a laser at a single point in space. The laser excites the sample and the produced light is captured by extremely sensitive photomultipliers. This way a State-of-the-Art spatial resolution is achieved. To allow for wide-field and functional imaging, the laser pointer has to be moved around the sample with high efficiency.

To this end, a commercially-accessible Electric Focus-Tunable Lens and high-precision mirror motors were put to use. Resulting setup allows for free 3D high spatial and temporal precision microscopy, suitable for both functional and anatomic tissue recordings. Comparable performance set-ups using different technologies typically cost tens of thousands more. This project is another example of our mindset of pursuing compact and modular cost-effective solutions.
