Monochromators produce light of very narrow bandwidths within the visible spectrum. They are widely used in vision research, cost upwards of 5k a piece and can generate light stimuli not faster than every 5 seconds. In this project, we adapted existing designs to build an ultrafast arbitrary-spectrum light generator at a fraction of that cost.

The design is based on a diffraction grating and an LED array. In a typical diffraction grating setup, one diffracts light at different angles to decompose a spectrum. In this setup different parts of the spectrum are arbitrarily collected to a single point. This design allows to extend the spectrum arbitrarily, as long as an LED exists in that emission region. LEDs can be easily controlled at a high speed. All the parts needed to beat SotA in this narrow niche cost around 1k, including self-designed controller circuits. Voila.
